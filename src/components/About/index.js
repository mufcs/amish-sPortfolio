        Hey there ðŸ‘‹ , I am Amish Adhikari. A software engineer graduate from General Assembly, with over 5 years of experience in IT industry as a Business Analyst and Scrum Master. I have a serious passion for UI effects, animations, creating intuitive and dynamic user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        Working in a product team within IT department and being technically illiterate, led me to the journey of being a software engineer. Moreover, being a gamer since childhood, I always carved a niche for myself, being a techno functional person.
        </p>
        <p>
        My colleagues describe me as a person who is not afraid of failure instead learn from it and innovate. Apart from work I play football, pool games, swim, dance and enjoy scooners/pints with my mates(i.e. professional and personal).I have excellent time management, interpersonal and analytical skills, with strong keep learning attitude.
