          I have been working as a Business Analyst with Product team, within IT department since last 5+ years. I have helped organisation by aligning their fluctuating business needs with emerging technologies such as SaaS, RPA, CRM, Digitization, API to attain business goals.

          I beleive iterative and incremental development leads to qualitative, sustainable, intuitive and user friendly product, it also helps to cultivate continuous improvement culture within a team. which shifts team's mindset to be pro-active rather than reactive. I have worked in different methodologies such as but not limited to Scrum, Agile, Prince2, Waterfall.
